# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction-Analysis

## Main Objective

> Objective to this project is to be able to build and evaluate the performances of different classification algorithms that can help us predict whether or not a client will be interested in vehicle insurance.

## Metric of Success


> To be able to build and evaluate the performances of different classification algorithms that can help us predict whether or not a client will be interested in vehicle insurance.

## Context

> Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

## Experimental Design 

* Import the relevant libraries that we will use in our analysis
* Read and explore the dataset we will use for our project
* Define the appropriateness of the available data with regards to the project
* Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
* Perform univariate and bivariate analysis while recording our observations.
* Implement the solution by using the various classifier algorithms to predict whether a client will be interested in vehicle insurance basing on the information provided.
* Challenge the solution by giving insights on how we can optimize the models to give us a better performance as compared to the baseline model.
* Provide recommendations based on the whole analysis and modelling techniques used in the project.

## Tools Used:

* Google Colaboratory Notebook.
* Trello Board.
